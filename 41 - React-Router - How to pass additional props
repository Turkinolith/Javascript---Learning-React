As noted before, the Route component passes 3 props to linked components. One question may be, what if I want to pass additional props to those components?
An example would be: Before routing I could pass props to the products component like this: <Products sortBy="" />
So how to set additional props with a route?
To do so instead of using the "component" attribute use the "render" attribute.
IE: <Route path='/products' render={() => <Products /> } />, there in the returned Products component you can add props:
	IE2: <Route path='/products' render={() => <Products sortBy="newest"/> } />
The arrow function in the render attribute takes no arguments and it returns a products component. 

**NOTE: The new returned Products no longer has the "history, location, match" props. How to add them back?
add props as an argument for the render attribute function, then have to add them as passed values for the returned component along with the new props.
How to do this? Use a special syntax in JSX. pass an object, then use spread operator and pass props object.
<Route path='/products' render={props => <Products sortBy="newest" {...props}/> } />
