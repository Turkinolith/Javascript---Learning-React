**** HTTP Clients ****
**********************

In react I need to send HTTP requests to a back-end to get and save data.
How to do that?
As noted in the start of the course, React is for building user interfaces, not client communications.
So, you would have to use a library you prefer to do this, unlike a framework like Angular which has ONLY HttpModule.

So what are the options?
[Fetch API] - Most modern browsers have the ability to send native requests using Fetch API.
[jQuery AJAX] - Older and very common.
[Axios] - Another very popular library and the one I'll be using.
