**** Registering a New User ****
********************************

The first thing that should be implemented is registering the user.

Before we start, lets verify that the DB responds to requests as expected. Load the mongoDB server and open postman
in postman send a GET request to the api/users, the DB should respond with a 404 error.

Now, switch the type to post, go to body, set to raw and JSON as the type.
Format the post in a test format like such:
{
	"email": "user1@domain.com",
	"password": "12345",
	"name": "Larry"
}

If you send that to the server you should get a 200 "OK" response.
If you send it a 2nd time you should get a 400 "Bad Request" user already registered reply.

200 or 400 should be the only valid replies to a Post request to users.
