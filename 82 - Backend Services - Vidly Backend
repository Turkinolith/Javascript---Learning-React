**** Vidly Backend ****
***********************
So far this movie doesn't have a backend. All the info is in memory.
If I refresh the page any changes I made are gone. So from here on I'll work to add a backend to it using a pre-built backend. (Its covered more in depth in the Node.js course)
The backend will consist of Node, Express, and MongoDB.
