*********************************
**** Building for Production ****
*********************************
I've been using "npm start" to begin my development of applications.
This gives a non-optimized development build, this is because the bundle it generates has additional code that helps with debugging the application.
But, when generating a build for production I do not want all of that extra code. I want an optimized production build.

To get this: "npm run build"

This will create an optimized production build, in this case in the "build" folder of the project.
The content of that folder can be sent to the web server using FTP or any other tools.

as npm will inform you, you can test it locally by installing serve: 
	npm install -g serve
this is a lightweight simple webserver.

And can start it using: 
	serve -s build

this loads the contents of the build folder into the serve webserver.

Install serve and launch it, by default it hosts on port 5000

When viewing the webapp there if I view the console I'll see "SUPERMAN undefined"
This is because I did not set an Environment variable for production.

Recap:
npm start -> development Build/Development environment variables
npm run build -> production Build/ Production environment variables
npm test -> Test Build/ Test environment variables
