**** Authentication and Authorization ****
******************************************
This section will involve extending the Vidly app to allow users to register, log-in, and log-out.

Will cover: 
JSON web tokens, 
calling protected API endpoints (endpoints that require the user to be logged in and/or have certain permissions), 
showing/hiding elements on a page based on user permissions, 
Protecting Routes so users can't navigate to certain parts of the app if they are not authorized.
