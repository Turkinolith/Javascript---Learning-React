#1 - Building a login form with Bootstrap

((( SETUP THE COMPONENT )))
In components folder of the Vidly app, create a new file: loginForm.jsx
	import react and component.
	create a component class called LoginForm.
		No state needed.
		It will return a basic <h1>Login</h1>
		
Now register a new route in app.jsx
	import LoginForm from ./components/loginForm
	Duplicate a route entry, I chose the first one, and change the path to /login and component to {LoginForm}
		*I ordered the components together so they are easier to read.
		
Next, add a link to the login form on the navigation bar.
	go to navbar.jsx in components/common
	Here I duplicate the last <NavLink> component, change the to="/login' and text to Login.
		*Sidenote: I had all of my NavLinks nested within a <ul> and <li>'s. This looks exactly the same without this so I removed those elements.
	
Quick test: I have the login link on the navbar, I click it and it displays the login component. Good. Time to build the bootstrap form.


((( BUILD THE LOGIN FORM )))

Go to the bootstrap docs and look at the needed markup to create a form.
I need a <form> element, inside that a <div with class "form-group"
	WIth this div we group the label to the corresponding input field.
	Inside the div there is: <label, <input, and some text in a <small tag, to give the user a hint about what to do.
	
	**NOTE: each label ( 1 for the username, 1 for the password ) has a for=" attribute with a unique string. "exampleInputEmail1" or "exampleInputPassword1" 
			The value of that for= is the id="" of a given <input/>. With this, when the user clicks on the label text, the referenced input gets automatically focused.
			
	**NOTE: Also note that <input> has the class="form-control"

Back in the loginForm.jsx:
	Wrap the <h1>Login</h1> with a div. 
	
	**Cool Trick: highlight all the text and press shift+ctrl+P, this opens the command bar in VSCode. type in there "wrap" and select "Wrap with Abbreviation", press enter.
				Now, you will have an empty bar with hint text "Enter Abbreviation", type the tag that you want to surround the text with. "div" Now the text is surrounded by a div tag!
				You can also do zen coding here, "div.container" and it will give it the proper classContainer attribute for a .jsx, however we just need a plain div here.
				
	Now I need a: form>div.form-group>label+input.form-control, I need 2 of these so I'll select everything from "div" over to the right, add paren around it all and *2 then hit enter.
		Now I'll get 2 fully set up divs with label and inputs.
		I don't need the action="" part of the form tag, so I get rid of that and fill out the labels for "Username" and "Password".
	
	The next thing I need to assign is the 'htmlFor=""' attribute.
		**NOTE: "For" is a reserved keyword in JS, so it is called here htmlFor, for the same reason I can't use class and have to use "className" instead.
	I add an 'id=""' field to both input tags, I set one to username and the other to password. I do the same for the "htmlFor=" field.
	
	Finally, I need a submit button so just outside of the form <div/>'s I add a <button> in, set the className to "btn btn-primary" and label it "Login"
	
		Final Code:
		
class LoginForm extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Login</h1>
        <form>
          <div className="form-group">
            <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
            <input id="username" type="text" className="form-control" />
          </div>
          <div className="form-group">
            <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
            <input id="password" type="text" className="form-control" />
          </div>
          <button className="btn btn-primary">Login</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

Now, if I check http://localhost:3000/login I'll get the login form with submit button.
