**** Extracting a Reusable Input ****
*************************************

In the current implementation there is some duplication:
	For each Input there is a <div className="form-group">, as well as a <label, and <input< field. Also some values are repeated. the value of the htmlFor=, which is "username" in the label is exactly the same as the id and name attributes of the <input>.
	We've repeated the same pattern in the password input as well.
	Nows a good time to extract the markup and put it within a reusable component.
	
So, in the common folder lets add a new file called input.jsx, import react and use a SFC since we don't care about state. Call it Input which takes props as the argument.
	Go back to the login form and Select the first container div with label and input and cut them and paste them into the return of the new component.
	Now lets make the necessary changes.
		#1 I have "username" in 3 places. lets replace these with {props.name}. Or make the code better and destructure the argument props into: ({ name }) and just replace the props.name with name.
		#2 Replace "username" with something from props. I'll call that {label}, and add that to the props destructuring as well. 
		#3 next I'll get rid of account.username and destructure that to {value} and once more, add that to props destructuring.
		#4 finally, replace this.handleChange with {onChange}
	So: ({ name, label, value, onChange }) is the interface of the Input component.

Now, back in loginForm.jsx, import Input from './common/input';
	Down in the return where we cut the data out we add in <Input />, now lets add the props into it: <Input name="username" value={account.username} label="Username" onChange={this.handleChange} />
	
Now, I can get rid of the Password field and its div, etc, Paste in the <input> and change the fields to point at the password field
		<Input
            name="password"
            value={account.password}
            label="Password"
            onChange={this.handleChange}
          />

Now, the text is far easier to read and understand.
