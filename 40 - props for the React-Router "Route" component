In my example the props of the "products" selection is:
history, location, match.
I didn't pass those props so where did they come from? It's one of the things the <Route> component does.
The <Route> component is essentially a wrapper for the component={} passed in it. So if the path matches the pattern, it'll render the component and auto inject those 3 props into it.
Uses History to work with the history object in the Browser and with that can send the user to a different page.
Location represents where the app is now.
Match contains info about how the URL matched the path set in the route.
