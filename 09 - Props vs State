Props vs State:

Props includes data that we give to a component
State includes data that is local or private to that component. Other compoents cannot access that state, it is completely internal to that component.

Example:
<Counter key={counter.id} value={counter.value} id={counter.id} />
This is where we're using the counter component, all of these attributes that are being set here are part of the props. The input to the component.
We cannot access the state of the component. The state is internal to the component.

Similarly, the counters component has its own local state which is completely invisible to other components.
Sometimes a component may not have a state, it'll get all the data it needs via props.

Another difference between props vs state is Props are read-only, we can not change the input to the component inside of it.
React will not allow you to change the properties of a props object. You need to get the input and put it in the state and modify it with setState.
