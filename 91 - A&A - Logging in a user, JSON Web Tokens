**** Logging in a User, JSON WEB TOKENS ****
********************************************

Similar to the api/users endpoint for creating a new user there is another, /api/auth for managing authentication sessions.
In order to log in a user we should send a POST request to that endpoint and in the body should have a JSON object with 2 properties. email and password. 
If we send a valid email and password combination the server will give us what we call a JSON web token.

To test this, I use Postman and point it towards http://localhost:3900/api/auth
Then, I create a JSON object with email and password for a known combination that gets passed into the backend.

If it is typoed or wrong I get: 400 Bad Request "Invalid email or password."
If it is correct I get: 200 OK and a long string of random letters/numbers. This is a JSON web token, like an ID card.

In the future whenever the client needs to call API endpoints that need the user to be authenticated the client will send this JSON web token back to the server. 
  The server will check the token, if it is valid then it will execute the client request.
