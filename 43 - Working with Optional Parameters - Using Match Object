**** Optional Parameters ****
*****************************

I added year and month as a parameter for the "posts" Route in App.js
If you look on the Posts page you will see year and month appear in the URL as well.
What happens if I exclude the month? I get the "home" component.

Why? 

Because when I put parameters within the route, by default those parameters are required. So in this case, the URL did not match the path as I didn't have a value for "posts" that was valid.
So, it continued down the Switch statement and matched up with "Home".

How can I make parameters optional?
Append a question mark to them after parameter name.
This is part of regular expressions in JS. in regexes when you append a question mark that means that expression is optional.

**** USING MATCH OBJECT ****
In posts.jsx I can either pass props as an argument to the Posts function, or I can destructure it and pass the match object { match }
Then, I can extract the Route parameters.
IE: Year: {match.params.year}, Month: {match.params.month}
Now, back in the browser I can see "Year: 2018, Month: 06, if I remove the month from the URL month changes to- Month:, similarly if I remove year as well I will still have the Posts page
but it will display: Year:,Month:
