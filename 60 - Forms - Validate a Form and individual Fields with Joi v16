**** Validating a form using Joi ****
*************************************

Looking at the object returned from Joi again: there is an error property, it is only set if there is at least one error, otherwise null. 
Within that error object it has a property "details" which is an array of objects. So, the challenging part of this task is to map that array into an object.

Back to the validate method: I'm calling this.schema.validate, I want to keep that but I'll get rid of everything else because I'll rewrite that from scratch.
	if (!result.error) return null; 
if result.error is falsy, return null,  otherwise get the array and map it into an object
	const errors = {};
Now I need to iterate over the array and for each error message add a new property to the object.
in the details array each object has a message property and a path property. These are the ones I'm interested in.
	The path property is an array and the first element in the array is the name of our target property.
One way to do this:
	For (let item of result.error.details) <- So I iterate over the array
		  errors[item.path[0]] = item.message;  <- Each item has a path property which is an array. The first element is the name of our target property. So, using bracket notation, we set errors of, the value of the property is an error message so item.message.
	Some developers don't like to use a for-of loop, they prefer to use .map method. We can also use .reduce but the implementation can get complicated. for clarity I'll use a for-of.
	Finally, I'll return the errors object.
	
*NOTE: On testing I noticed that the error message returned: ""username" is not allowed to be empty"
	The capitalization is off, this is because the username: field is lowercase in the schema. 
	When displaying errors to the user we want the names to be clear as to what they are going to, case matching.
	So, in the schema I can call another method .label and assign an override name to it: .label('Username')
	
  schema = Joi.object({
    username: Joi.string()
      .alphanum()
      .min(3)
      .required()
      .label("Username"),
    password: Joi.string()
      .min(5)
      .required()
      .label("Password")
  });
  
  So, I'm done implementing the validate method, but there are a few things that could be improved here.
	#1 - I'm referencing result.error in a couple of places, so this is an opportunity for object destructuring.
		Replace "result" in the const for "this.schema.validate" to { error }, then replace result.error with error
	#2 - the object assign for the option for the validate method looks weird, the curly braces make it look like a code block and its being linted down into its own line making the syntax of the function call hard to read.
		I'll define a new constant, pass that info into it, then call the constant instead for the 3rd value.
			    const validateOption = { abortEarly: false };
				const { error } = this.schema.validate(this.state.account, validateOption);
	
	To make the validate option work correctly with v16 of Joi I wrap a copy of the schema within a Joi.object, then use that object for the validate function.
	
Final Code:
	validate = () => {
		const localSchema = Joi.object(this.schema);
		const validateOption = { abortEarly: false };
		const { error } = localSchema.validate(this.state.account, validateOption);
		if (!error) return null;

		const errors = {};
		for (let item of error.details) errors[item.path[0]] = item.message;
		return errors;
	};
	
	

**************************************
**** Validating a FIELD using Joi ****
**************************************
Now to reimplement the validateProperty method.
I'll take the same approach used in the validate method.
 for the schema I can't pass this.state.account because that will validate the entire form. in this case I just want to validate a single field.
 So, I'll create a new object. It should only have a single property. The name of it should be set dynamically based upon the value of the "name" argument.
 So, if name is "username" it should have a property called username: and the value should be the "value" argument.
 But, I don't want to hardcode the name, it should be set dynamically, so here is where we use computed properties.
 Replace the hardcoded key with square brackets and pass name: [name]. So, whatever the value is passed for name at runtime will be whats used to set the key.
 Now, I'll wrap that computed key/value pair into a Joi.object as per the Joi v16 syntax and save it into a constant called localSchema. This is essentially a filtered schema that only holds the parts relivent to the matched value.
 
Final Code:
	  validateProperty = ({ name, value }) => {
		const obj = { [name]: value };
		const localSchema = Joi.object({ [name]: this.schema[name] });
		const { error } = localSchema.validate(obj);
		return error ? error.details[0].message : null;
	  };
