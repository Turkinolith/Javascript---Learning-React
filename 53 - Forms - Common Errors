**** Common Errors with Forms ****
**********************************
#1 - Missing state property -
 "A component is changing an uncontrolled input of type text to controlled"
 I removed a property, like username. So if I try to access account.username I'll get "undefined". 
 Undefined and Null can not be used as values of a controlled element.
 in other words when I'm setting the value of a username field if I pass undefined or null there React will not see that element as a controlled element. So this element will have its own state and value but the moment I type the first
 character, because I'm listening for the change and updating the state, now account.username becomes "value" and now I'm passing it as the value of that inputfield and thats why I get the warning. Initially I start with an uncontrolled element
and now its a controlled element.

#2 - Initialized property with undefined or null
	Similarly, I'll get an error if I start a component with null or undefined as a state value. I can't do that. Use an empty string or some value I get from the server for a component
