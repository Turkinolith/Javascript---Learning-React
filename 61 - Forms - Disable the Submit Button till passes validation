**** Disabling the Submit Button ****
*************************************
I want the "Login" button to be disabled unless the form is valid. 
	***NOTE: Without as-you-type field validation you wont be told "WHY" the button is disabled. So, still need that at some point.

In the loginForm.jsx, go to the <button element and there add a disabled attribute. It can be set to either true or false.
So, I can call disabled={this.validate()) 
This method either returns null or returns an object with one or more errors. If it returns null, that is considered "falsy" and is the same as passing "false" here.
Similarly, if it returns an object it is considered "truthy" so its similar to passing true here.
