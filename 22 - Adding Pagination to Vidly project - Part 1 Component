Exercise: Adding Pagination to Vidly
#1 - Add a pagination component - Want this to be completely decoupled from "movies" app.
#2 - Start with a Stateless Functional Component, because this likely wont have a state. : irc + sfc, pass props as an argument, return null for now.
#3 - When I want to build a reusable component before implementing it I should think of the interface. what inputs will it recieve, what events will it raise?
The best way to decide the interface of a component is to use it before implementing it.
#4 - import it into the movies.jsx.
#5 - In the render method, below the table of movies, there I will call the component. Consider what inputs need to be given to it. 
instructor believes we need total number of items and page size. Based upon that, the component can calculate the total number of pages and render them.
#6 - Set the inputs: itemsCount and pageSize. itemsCount would be this.state.movies.count, but earlier on I already made a destructuring assignement so I can just use "count"
	For pageSize I will need to store that in the state, so I'll make a prop declaration: this.state.pageSize, then I go up to the state and add that in. I'll hard set that to 4.
	These were the inputs of the component, but it should also raise an event whenever the user clicks on a new page. I'll call that: onPageChange, which will be a method.
#7 - Add the handlePageChange method, it should obtain as an argument the new page number. For now I'll just console.log the page.
