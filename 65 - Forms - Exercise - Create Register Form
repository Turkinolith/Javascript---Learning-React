**** Register Form Exercise ****
********************************

Build a Register form that has 3 input fields. Username, Password, and Name
Username: Should be a valid email format, if you type something you should get the alert ("Username" must be a valid email) IE: asd@asd.com
Password: Should be at minimum 5 characters.
Name: A basic string
Has a button component labeled "Register" it should be disabled until validate checks are passed.

Note: this will not actually register users, this will come later. so for this just build the form and add a link to the navigation bar.

*** NOTE: To get the email validation option to work I had to create my own TLD validation. apparently the web version of Joi doesn't include the IANA registry list by default to save space.
	To fix this, I had to define my own:
		      .email({minDomainSegments: 2,tlds: { allow: ["com", "net", "org", "edu"] }})
	See docs here: https://joi-tester.corneroftheinternet.rocks/public/html/docs.html#stringemailoptions

#1 - Make registerForm.jsx
  This was almost the same as loginForm.jsx
  Differences were I added an additional data to the state 'nameuser: ""', added an additional schema and adjusted other schemas to match 
  the requirements needed.
  (Had to do additional work for email validation, see above.)
  Add another renderInput entry for the "nameuser","Name" field.

#2 navbar.jsx added an entry to the register page as a NavLink.

#3 in App.js add a Route path for RegisterForm and import it
