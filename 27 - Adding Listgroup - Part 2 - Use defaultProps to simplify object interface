	**Simplifying interface by creating defaultProps
#6 - Adding the 2 properties (textProperty and valueProperty) work, but it makes the interface of the ListGroup component complex. The fewer props we have to pass, the easier it is to use.
	In this case I can assume most of the objects have those two properties (_id and name) so I can set the default value for the props and if in the future I'm working with a different kind of object
	that doesn't have those properties I can override the default values.
	Back in the listGroup.jsx i'll set default props for the component. 
	After the ListGroup const is defined, I'll add a new entry for defaultprops and set it to an object.
		IE: ListGroup.defaultProps = {  textProperty: 'name', valueProperty: '_id'};
	With this done, I can remove the props assignment for these from movies.jsx as I no longer have to pass those props. This simplifies the interface of the list group.
