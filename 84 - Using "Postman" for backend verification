**** Disabling Authentication in Vidly-API-Node ****
****************************************************
Before modifying the app to the node backend, first I'll make sure that I can create a movie by sending an HTTP request to the movies end point.
To do this, I'll use the app "Postman"
This app lets me send a bunch of different HTTP requests and see the responses.

Open a new tab in postman and in the request URL point it towards http://localhost:3900/api/movies
*Note, on the left side of the bar where it says "GET" you can change it to other access types. leave it GET for now and hit send
You'll get a bunch of data below, this is the DB response.

Lets see if we can create data:
Change the type to "POST" and click on the body tab, there select the "raw" radio button and change the type to "JSON"
In the box add a new object. then fill out the data as if we were submitting a raw JSON object.
**NOTE: make sure to put the keys in double quotes as that is the only correct way to do so in the JSON format.
	{
	"title": "A new movie from postman",
	"numberInStock": 1,
	"dailyRentalRate": 2,
	"genreId": "5e0c34fb1408cc5d0ce93655"
	}

When hit "send" I'll get an error: 
404 Unauthorized
Access denied. No token provided.

I'll do authorization in the next section, so for now to make sure the app works with the backend I'll temporarily disable authentication using a configuration setting.
This is purely for this course so I don't get caught up in the details of authentication. It's not something I should do in a production environment.

1- In terminal stop the web server by ctrl+C 
2- Open project in VS Code and go to the config folder, opening the file "default.json"
3- There is a bool key "requiresAuth" just set to false.
4- Back in terminal node index.js again and go back to postman and try sending the post again.
5- This time got back a response with status "200 OK" and the data that I sent along with a unique identifier.
