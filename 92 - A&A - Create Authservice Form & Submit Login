***********************************
**** Submitting the Login Form ****
***********************************

Once again in the services folder, add a new JS file named "authService"
This will be responsible for operations like Log-in and Log-out.
To speed things up will copy the 2 import and the endpoint lines from movieService and paste them into the new file.
change the apiEndpoint to /auth.

Then export a function login(email,password) 
it should call http.post pass apiendpoint, and pass an object with 2 properties, email and password. then return the promise from this function

	export function login(email, password) {
		return http.post(apiEndpoint, { email, password });
	}

Now on the login form import the new service, I can import just one function with using curly braces.
Now, in the "doSubmit" method replace what is there with:
	login(this.state.data.username, this.state.data.password)
Or replace that with object destructuring:
	const { data } = this.state;
	login(data.username, data.password);
Then, await and async it:
Final:
	  doSubmit = async () => {
		const { data } = this.state;
		await login(data.username, data.password);
	  };

Test in the browser, I got errors on email. On investigation I found out that I was passing the password/username backwards :(  
so, fixed the code and login returns the TOKEN now!
