Named and default exports:
Named exports are explictly defined with the "export" keyword in front of the variable name.
Adding "default" keyword after export makes that object the main thing exported from the module.
on the import side, you use curly braces to import a named export.
IE: import { Teacher } from "./teacher";
but if it is a default export you don't neeed them.
IE: import Teacher from "./teacher"

It's possible to have both a default and named export in the same file
To import them, you mix them together:
IE: import Teacher, { promote } from "./teacher";

or: import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
Note we don't have ./ before react for the path. we use that for our own modules that are part of the project.
React isn't part of the project, its a 3rd party library stored inside the node modules folder. 
React is the default export and Component is the named.
