Named and default exports:
Named exports are explictly defined with the "export" keyword in front of the variable name.
Adding "default" keyword after export makes that object the main thing exported from the module.
on the import side, you use curly braces to import a named export.
IE: import { Teacher } from "./teacher";
but if it is a default export you don't neeed them.
IE: import Teacher from "./teacher"
