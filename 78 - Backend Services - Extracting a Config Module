**** Extracting a Config Module ****
************************************

The other thing that can be improved in app.js is to take out the apiEndpoint constant. 
Chances are I'll use that endpoint in several places in the application so I don't want to hard-code it on top of app module.
Lets move it into a configuration file.

1- In source folder, add a new file. config.json
2- add an empty JSON object and add a key called "apiEndpoint" and set it to the URL string.
	Here I could have several other config parameters currently only have the API endpoint.
3- Now, remove the constant line from app.js.
4- import config from './config.json';
5- Now, anywhere in the code that references apiEndpoint, I can prefix them with config.apiEndpoint
	IE:   
	*OLD*
	async componentDidMount() {
    const { data: posts } = await httpService.get(apiEndpoint);
    this.setState({ posts });
  }
  
	*NEW*
	  async componentDidMount() {
    const { data: posts } = await httpService.get(config.apiEndpoint);
    this.setState({ posts });
  }
