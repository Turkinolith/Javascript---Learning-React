*********************************
**** Deploying the Front-End ****
*********************************
#1 - As before, create a git repository if you have not already done so.
#2 - use a buildpack for apps created with create-react-app.   https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/mars/create-react-app-buildpack
	A buildpack is a collection of scripts that prepare an app to be deployed to heroku. There are a bunch of them for various environments, ruby, node, etc.
		heroku create --buildpack mars/create-react-app

Setting buildpack to mars/create-react-app... done
https://frozen-fjord-67313.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/frozen-fjord-67313.git

#3 - The final step is to push our code from our local repository to the remote repository.
	git push heroku master
	heroku open
	
	YAY! IT WORKS!
