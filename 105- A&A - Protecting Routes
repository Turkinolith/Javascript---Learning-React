**** Protecting Routes ****
***************************

In the last lesson, I hid the "New Movie" button, but if I put in the correct URL for that page into the title bar, I can still access that form without logging in.

How to protect the route?
In App.js, the path for the form is the one with path '/movies':id', I already set it to use the render method instead of component. I can also use this same technique to protect it. 
I can pass a function, in that function check if the current user is null, if so redirect them. Otherwise then render the form.

In the body check if user is falsy, if so return the <Redirect component back to the login page. Otherwise return as it currently stands.

To define user, use object destructuring in the render method, but before the return to define user as this.state
Then, any place in the return where I was defining user as this.state.user can be simplified to user={user}

render() {
    const { user } = this.state;
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <ToastContainer />
        <NavBar user={user} />
        <main className="container">
          <Switch>
            <Route path="/register" component={RegisterForm} />
            <Route path="/login" component={LoginForm} />
            <Route path="/logout" component={Logout} />
            <Route
              path="/movies/:id"
              render={props => {
                if (!user) return <Redirect to="/login" />;
                return <MovieForm {...props} user={user} />;
              }}
            />
            <Route
              path="/movies"
              render={props => <Movies {...props} user={user} />}
            />

Now if I try to access localhost:3000/movies/new without being logged in, I'll get redirected to the login form.
In the future I'll add the redirect URL so the momen the user loggs in they will be redirected back to where they came from.

So, this is how to protect a route. However, this is not an easy solution to re-use in multiple places.
Next I'll go over how to build a reusable route component that is aware of the current user and can auto-redirect the user if they are not logged in.
