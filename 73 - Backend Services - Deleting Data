**** Deleting Data ****
***********************
Finally lets look at deleting data.
Once again call axios:
	handleDelete = post => {
		axios.delete()
	};
	
The URL is exactly the same as for updating data.
	handleDelete = async post => {
		await axios.delete(`${apiEndpoint}/${post.id}`);
	};
When deleting data, we don't need to include anything in the body of the request, we just need the URL that identifies the resource.
At this point the resource should be deleted from the server, so now we just need to update the UI.

	handleDelete = async post => {
		await axios.delete(`${apiEndpoint}/${post.id}`);
		const posts = this.state.posts.filter(p => p.id !== post.id);  // This will return all posts except for the one we are deleting.
		this.setState({ posts });
	};
